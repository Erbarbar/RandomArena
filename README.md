# RandomArena

#### What it is:


This is a game (work in progress) that aims to resemble (Binding Of Isaac)[http://bindingofisaac.com]. However, the game will be online and multiplayer (and probably mobile).


#### Why though?


To increase my experience in game development, I decided to try to create a game from the ground up as similar as possible to an already existing one. I chose Binding of Isaac, because I like the way randomness is used, and all the different components of the game seem interesting to code.

#### Disclaimer:


I'm not trying to use the Binding of Isaac brand for profit. I'll try to stay away from sprites resembling too much the originals as much as possible, so i don't get hit by a copyright strike. Everything that I do is only based on wikis and gameplay observation.
